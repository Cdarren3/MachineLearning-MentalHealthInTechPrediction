# Machine Learning Project Mental Health in Tech Survey

This project aims to find out the predictability of whether a survey respondent has attended a mental health treatment by various machine learning models.


## Inspiration(TBC)
Some questions worth exploring:

What are the strongest predictors of mental health illness or certain attitudes towards mental health in the workplace?


## Business Values

* Identify the needs for mental health resources

* Satisfaction assessment criteria among Employees 

* Re-evaluate the health insurance coverage

* Develop a more effective diagnosis protocol



## About the Dataset

This data comes from OSMI Institution and from data description we know that this dataset is from a 2014 survey that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace.

Details of the dataset could be found in <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey">Here</a>


## Preprocessing

* Outlier Handling

* Impute Missing Values

* Data Cleaning


## Models Evaluation

## Takeaway

* Able to predict whether the respondent have sought for medical treatment for mental health with the highest accuracy of XX.XX%

* Difficult to predict whether respondents currently have needs for mental health support, due to the setting of the questionnaire and the privacy issues come along


## Future Improvement

* Retain the states data for respondent's geographical location prediction

* Further analysis on comments using NLP technique

* Try other boosting models which might yield a more accurate prediction

* Try unsupervised model like t-SNE for cluster identification
