# Machine Learning Project_Mental Health in Tech Survey

This project aims to find out the predictability of whether a survey respondent has attended a mental health treatment by various machine learning models 

## Business Values

-Identify the needs for mental health resources

-Satisfaction assessment criteria among Employees 

-Re-evaluate the health insurance coverage

-Develop a more effective diagnosis protocol



## About the Dataset

This data comes from OSMI Institution and from data description we know that this dataset is from a 2014 survey that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace.

Details of the dataset could be found in <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey">Here</a>

## Preprocessing

* Outlier Handling
* Impute Missing Values
* Data Cleaning


* Drop Risk_mm
* Inpute Missing Values
* Drop All the Categorical Volumns
* Filter Out Common Columns For Both Dataset
* Split Train/Test Data
* Remove Outlier
* Feature Scaling


## Models Evaluation

## Conclusion & Future Improvement
Able to predict whether the respondent have sought for medical treatment for mental health with the highest accuractely of XX.XX%
Difficult to predict whether respondents have needs for mental health support, due to the setting of the questionnaire and the privacy issues come along


####In the future :

-Retain the states data for respondent's geographical location prediction

-Further analysis on comments using NLP technique

-Try other boosting models which might yield a more accurate prediction

-Try unsupervised model like t-SNE for cluster identification




## Inspiration
Some questions worth exploring:

What are the strongest predictors of mental health illness or certain attitudes towards mental health in the workplace?
